While I want to keep learning Ruby as it seems like a fun language, the demands of the current job market probably makes it better for me to learn Python rather than Ruby. As such, I am pausing doing my work in Ruby and am switching to Python for dev purposes.

That doesn't mean I won't stop, but there are priorities as to what I need to add other than C/C++ and Java.
